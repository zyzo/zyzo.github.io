Well, technically, hello world again! I used [tumblr][tumblr] as my blog platform before, but the design and functionality just don't seem really appealing to me. So I'm switching to [Jekyll][jekyll].

After several hours spending on the documentation and [picking a theme][jekyllthemes], I was able to set up my customized and free blog webpage. Even though my experience with jekyll is limited, I already love its concept and its simplicity.

Many thanks for the jekyll team for an awesome product and [Lijia Yu][lijiayu] for a nice and clean template, so that I can get my new blog running quickly.
